> Grunt copy plugin, only copy modified files.

## Need Help?
It starts at the very beginning (including how to properly set-up your command-line on Windows and Mac OS X), and goes beyond the official [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-copy-modified --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-copy-modified');
```
